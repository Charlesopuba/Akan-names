-  The application should check whether the date and month entered is valid. if either of them is invalid,  the user should be alerted and asked to enter a valid one. For example:
        An invalid day should be (d<=0) or (d>31)

        An invalid month should be (m<= 0) or (m > 12)  

   - A user should enter his/her birthday through a form
   - Choose what gender I am
   -Click the submit button to see what my Akan name would be
